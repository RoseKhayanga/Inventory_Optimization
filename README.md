# Inventory_Optimization
This is  an end to end solution to track reorder levels, stock availability,predict and estimate optimal restock dates and analyze supplier delivery times.

The goal was to simulate a real-world system that could help a business track procurement, inventory, and supplier performance in real time. I started by designing a relational data model with interconnected tables â€” covering suppliers, products and inventory.

Using SQL, I wrote queries to monitor:

1. Supplier delivery lead times

2. Order fulfillment rates

3. Stock levels, including identifying stockouts and forecasting reorder needs

I then transitioned to Power BI, where I built an interactive dashboard that visualized:

1. On-time delivery rates per supplier

2. Inventory turnover and reorder alerts

3. Order fulfillment efficiency and supplier comparisons

I also used DAX measures and calculated columns to estimate optimal restock dates and created slicers to let users drill down by product, supplier, and region.

As a result, the dashboard became a decision-support tool that could help a supply chain team:

a) Identify underperforming suppliers

b) Reduce holding costs by flagging slow-moving inventory

c) Respond faster to restocking needs
